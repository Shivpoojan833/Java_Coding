## Overview

This repository contains my **Java implementations of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** along with **core Java programming concepts**.
The purpose of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills, reinforce algorithmic thinking, and maintain a well-structured reference for interviews and academic preparation.

All code is written with **clarity, correctness, and performance** in mind.
